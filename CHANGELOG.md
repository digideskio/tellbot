tellbot CHANGELOG
=================

# 0.2.0.1

- added support for IRC server anti-DDoS and netsplit
- the bot tries to rejoin the room if kicked

# 0.2.0.0

- Fixed flood attempts
- Changed !tell behavior; now the tellbot will refuse to record your message if
  the recipient is already in the same room as you and the tellbot – the
  recipient has to be out of the room – and it will tell the message(s) when
  the recipient joins

# 0.1.0.0

- Initial release
